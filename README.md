### Abstract
###### 
Sharks have been evolving on earth for more than 400 million years. Yet, they are seen as from a far as these mythical creatures an insatiatibale appetite for human flesh. Our motivation for this research project was stemming from our personal experience with marine and aquatic life.

Two of our group members have been a part of aquatic activities, a shark in the case of 1 and a dolphin in the case of the other. This piqued our curiousity in marine conservation. In this research project we set out to explore multiple datasets to see who is more endanged by other other, i.e. humans or sharks. We try to present the result using the conceptual design framework and mechanical implementation tools learned in this class.

We have tried to do this through a multitude of diverse charts and graphs, including, but not limnited to:

1. Column Chart
2. Line Graph
3. Proportional Area Chart
4. Waterfall Graph
5. Choropleth 3D
6. Complex Choropleth in combination with pie chart and bar charts.
