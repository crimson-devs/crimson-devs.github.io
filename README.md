### Abstract
###### Two of our group members have been a part of aquatic activities, a shark in the case of 1 and a dolphin in the case of the other. This piqued our curiousity in marine conservation. Sharks are misunderstood. In this research project we set out to explore multiple datasets to see who is more endanged by other other, i.e. humans or sharks. We try to present the result using the conceptual design framework and mechanical implementation tools learned in this class.
